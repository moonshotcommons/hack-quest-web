Instead of setting up centralized servers, GaiaNet is building a distributed network of edge-computing nodes controlled by individuals and businesses, to host fine-tuned AI models, based on the node operator’s proprietary domain knowledge and expertise. Each GiaiaNet node is a digital twin of a real-world expert or personality, such as a university teaching assistant, a high school teacher, a crypto trader, or a customer service agent, performing skilled knowledge tasks on behalf of its creator or operator. GaiaNet boldly challenges the centralized industry giants that have dominated the AI lifecycle, from data collection to model training and fine-tuning.'

As decentralized technologies mature into the building blocks for open metaverse economies, smart contract platforms raised over $50 billion in 2022 alone. New unicorn projects now launch monthly across NFTs, digital identity, tokenized fan engagement, governance design, and composable DeFi.\n With web3 inhabiting the cutting edge, immense opportunities await those armed with the right applied blockchain skillsets and community-centric mindsets. Through exposure to successful entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists, as well as an overview of open challenges in the industry, we hope to equip those seeking to conceive and actualize ventures natively built for user ownership.`
