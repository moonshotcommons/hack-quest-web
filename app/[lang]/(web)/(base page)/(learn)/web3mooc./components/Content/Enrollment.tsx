              NTU I&E x HackQuest MOOC is free and open to all individuals interested in Web3. The MOOC is designed to
              be universally accessible, featuring an online educational model that includes one to two-hour weekly
              sessions, both on- and off-campus. This approach ensures accessibility for an international audience and
              allows participants to review the content at their convenience.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don’t have to be an enrolled NTU student to access the course materials and synchronous sessions and
              be eligible for proof of completion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This MOOC is also designed to prepare students in Singapore for the Port63 Challenge Web3 Track that will
              take place shortly after the end of the MOOC.

              The Port63 Challenge, a proud flagship of NTU I&E, is a unique initiative that goes beyond the
              conventional educational approach, allowing participants to apply their knowledge, gain fresh
              perspectives, and analyse real-world challenges.
